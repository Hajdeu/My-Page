  Hey, my name is Vasy and I'm a robotics engineer. 
  I started my studies in the field of CAD design engineering and since then I have set some targets in terms of education.
  I finished high school as a national champion in mechanical CAD design. Then I wanted more and started the Polytechnic University in the field of industrial robots. 
  This field allowed me to expand my knowledge in the field of electricity, mechatronics, automation. 
  Now I want to take a step forward and get to know the IT field, namely to become a Full-Stack Developer.
</p>
  
 <p> If I were to tell a little bit about my professional career, it also has a beautiful ascent. I have been in the market for 7 years, and I started working since university. I started with a part-time job at a small cold sheet metal processing company. Here we design and execute series products, as well as custom made. As a series product range, we had low, medium and high voltage cable routes and we also had modular house structures. After these we had cases for the coffee machines.
- I started there with 3D representations and creating catalogs to present the company and its services.
- I continued with obtaining patents for a metal structure for the construction of houses on the metal structure.
- After that I started to take over clients' projects. I took the idea, conceived the solution, presented it to the client and trained the team of 7 technicians to execute the work. Sometimes the clients also asked for painted parts, for these situations I also take care of the logistic flow for painting the parts.
And the biggest project I designed was the facade of a university that represented a train. This was my challenge from those times, and I successfully executed it. That project brought me the closest to the team. The biggest project I designed was the facade of a university that represented a train. This was my challenge from those times, and I successfully executed it. That project promoted me within the team as a team leader.

<p>At EXCENT I worked from 2018 to 2019 as a Designer Engineer, after some time I was
  nominated as project manager for one of EXCENT clients. For this client,
 <li>I worked on two positions at the same time: Project manager for change
  of supplier sourcing and business representative</li> 
  <li>We received a supplier change request for a particular piece of the
  car body. We studied the database to find suppliers,</li>
  <li>We asked for the price and transport offer from each supplier.</li> 
  <li>After choosing the supplier, we made a logistical flow for each
  plant that needed to test the new parts from the chosen
  supplier.</li>
  <li>When we sent the parts, we informed the technical department of
  the plant and let them know of the procedure to be followed.</li>
  <li>At the end of the trials, we received 3D control and assembly
  reports.</li>
  <li>Based on these reports, we decided whether or not we continue
  with the new vendor.</li>
 <p>As a business representative, I worked with four more colleagues on
  the car body serial life. There was a pretty simple procedure just to
  follow some steps.</p>
  <li>We received a specification from the plant.</li>
  <li>We analyzed the problem with the team.</li> 
  <li>We fixed the cause of the problem,</li>
  <li>We contacted the supplier, described the problem and the
  theoretical cause.</li>
  <li>The supplier proposed a solution together with the costs and
  planning to solve the problem.</li> 
  <li>I went to an approval committee for this change;</li> 
  <li>After approval, the affected plants were supplied with the new trial
  parts</li> 
  <li>If the plants approved the new part, we replaced the new piece
  reference in the system and replaced it in the production stream.</li>

<img src="/assets/images/Makita-logo.png" height="50" alt="Makita Logo"<p>In the 3 month internship at Makita, I deepened my knowledge in the field  of automation.
   <li>I was part of a 3 automation engineers team.</li>
   <li>I worked with PLCs and OMRON components.</li>
   <li>I learned programming with Leader Diagram (basic user).</li>
   <li>I programmed from scratch a mechanism with three axes of translation, based on an electrical
  sketch.</li>>
