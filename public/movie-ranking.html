    This movie is teaching us loyalty, devotion, 
    and the bond between humans and animals. 
    The film explores themes of love, loss, and the power of simple gestures 
    to connect us with others. It also touches on the theme of perseverance, 
    as the dog Hachi continues to wait for his owner despite many years passing. 
    Additionally, the film highlights the concept of "mono no aware," 
    a Japanese term that describes the bittersweet awareness of the 
    impermanence of all things. </p>

<h3> Iron Man (2008) </h3>

    the consequences of war and weapons manufacturing, the power of technology 
    and innovation, the importance of personal responsibility,
    and the hero's journey. </p>

     The main ideas in the movie 2012 include the potential consequences 
    of environmental disasters, the human struggle for survival in the face of catastrophic events, 
    the power of human connection and compassion in times of crisis, 
    and the importance of family and community. The film also explores the theme of global cooperation, 
    as countries work together to try to save humanity from extinction. 
    Additionally, the movie touches on the idea of renewal and the potential for new beginnings, 
    even in the midst of destruction and chaos. </p>
